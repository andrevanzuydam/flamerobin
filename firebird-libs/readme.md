# Firebird Libraries

My idea for this folder is to include the libraries for Mac build in the application deployment
It is always a pain to install firebird and get it working whereas we can build these files so long 
and include them in the setup if we want.

From the project folder (assumes you have firebird installed here)
```bash
cp /opt/firebird/lib/* ./firebird-libs
```
